## Overview

This project requires the development of a data pipeline using Airflow (or a similar orchestration tool) to handle the journey from data acquisition to preprocessing, testing, versioning, and workflow management.  
**Goal**: Ensure reproducibility, reliability, data quality, and fairness at every stage of your machine learning pipeline.

---

## Key Components to Include

1. **Data Acquisition**

   - [ ] Ensure all data sources (APIs, databases, etc.) are well-documented.
   - [ ] Provide reproducible code or scripts for fetching/downloading data.
   - [ ] List dependencies in `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.

2. **Data Preprocessing**

   - [ ] Outline clear steps for data cleaning, transformations, and feature engineering.
   - [ ] Write modular, reusable preprocessing code.

3. **Test Modules**

   - [ ] Implement unit tests for each component (particularly preprocessing and transformation).
   - [ ] Use `pytest` or `unittest` to handle edge cases and anomalies.

4. **Pipeline Orchestration (Airflow DAGs)**

   - [ ] Organize tasks into a logical sequence using Airflow (or similar).
   - [ ] Ensure end-to-end workflow coverage, from initial data fetch to final output.

5. **Data Versioning with DVC**

   - [ ] Track and version control all datasets with DVC.
   - [ ] Store `.dvc` files in version control alongside the code.

6. **Tracking and Logging**

   - [ ] Integrate Python’s logging or Airflow’s built-in logging.
   - [ ] Set up monitoring for anomalies and notifications for errors.

7. **Data Schema & Statistics Generation**

   - [ ] Automatically generate schemas (using TFDV, Great Expectations, etc.).
   - [ ] Validate data quality and schema consistency over time.

8. **Anomaly Detection & Alerts**

   - [ ] Implement checks for missing values, outliers, and invalid formats.
   - [ ] Configure alerts (e.g., email, Slack) for anomalies.

9. **Pipeline Flow Optimization**
   - [ ] Use Airflow’s Gantt chart (or equivalent) to identify bottlenecks.
   - [ ] Optimize tasks (parallelization, performance improvements) as needed.

## Data Bias Detection Using Data Slicing

1. **Detecting Bias in Your Data**

   - [ ] Identify demographic/categorical features (age, gender, location, etc.).
   - [ ] Measure performance differences across subgroups.

2. **Data Slicing for Bias Analysis**

   - [ ] Use tools like TFMA, Fairlearn, or SliceFinder to split data into slices.
   - [ ] Evaluate model performance for each slice.

3. **Mitigation of Bias**

   - [ ] Apply re-sampling, fairness constraints, threshold adjustments, or other strategies to address bias.
   - [ ] Record decisions and trade-offs made for bias mitigation.

4. **Document Bias Mitigation Process**
   - [ ] Detail the bias types discovered.
   - [ ] Explain how bias was addressed and any performance compromises.

## Additional Guidelines

1. **Folder Structure**  
   /ProjectRepo  
   ├─ Data-Pipeline/  
   │ ├─ dags/  
   │ ├─ data/  
   │ ├─ scripts/  
   │ ├─ tests/  
   │ └─ logs/  
   ├─ dvc.yaml  
   └─ README.md

   - [ ] Ensure consistent organization of code, data, and logs.

2. **README Documentation**

   - [ ] Provide setup instructions (environment, dependencies).
   - [ ] Explain how to run the pipeline.
   - [ ] Include notes on data versioning (DVC) and reproducibility.

3. **Reproducibility**

   - [ ] Offer step-by-step guidance to run the pipeline on a fresh machine.
   - [ ] Ensure all dependencies are installable from your `requirements.txt` or `environment.yml`.

4. **Code Style**

   - [ ] Adhere to PEP 8.
   - [ ] Keep code modular, clear, and maintainable.

5. **Error Handling & Logging**
   - [ ] Anticipate and handle failure points (e.g., missing data, file corruption).
   - [ ] Include sufficiently descriptive logs to aid in troubleshooting.

- [ ] **Schema & Statistics Generation**

  - Automated data schema validations (e.g., TFDV, Great Expectations).

- [ ] **Anomaly Detection & Alert Generation**

  - Mechanisms for detecting missing values, outliers, schema violations, etc.

- [ ] **Bias Detection & Mitigation**

  - Data slicing for subgroups, fairness strategies, and documentation.

- [ ] **Test Modules**
