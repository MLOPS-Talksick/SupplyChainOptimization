# SupplyChainOptimization

> **Smarter Demand. Leaner Supply. 
> Forecasting product demand isn't just about predicting numbers—it's about enabling intelligent decisions across your supply chain. This project delivers a production-ready, cloud-deployable LSTM pipeline backed by a complete MLOps stack for real-time business impact.

---

## Objective

This repository implements an end-to-end **LSTM-based demand forecasting system** with a fully integrated **MLOps architecture**. It automates the lifecycle from raw data ingestion to model health checks, Dockerized deployment, and real-time monitoring. Designed for high-frequency retail or manufacturing data, the system scales effortlessly using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** and **Vertex AI**.

## Key Features

- **LSTM Forecasting:** Deep learning model tailored for time series prediction of product demand.
- **Robust Data Handling:** Includes pre-validation, preprocessing, and post-cleaning checks.
- **Productionized Model:** Packaged using Docker and deployed via CI/CD on GCP.
- **Automated Health Checks:** Validates model accuracy and detects drift using metrics like RMSE, MAPE, and KS-test p-values.
- **Email Notifications:** Alerts stakeholders in real time upon failure or anomalies.
- **Scalable Training:** Leveraged via **Vertex AI** for on-demand model retraining.

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MLOPS-Talksick/SupplyChainOptimization.git
cd SupplyChainOptimization
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# Upgrade pip and install dependencies
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set environment variables
touch .env
```

Edit the `.env` file and add:

```env
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/absolute/path/to/your/cloud_run.json
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5001
GCP_PROJECT=your-gcp-project-id
BUCKET_NAME=your-gcs-bucket-name
```

(Optional) Start MLflow Tracking Server:

```bash
mlflow ui --port 5001
```

(Optional) Authenticate with GCP CLI:

```bash
gcloud auth activate-service-account --key-file=$GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS
gcloud config set project $GCP_PROJECT
```

(Optional) Build and run Docker container:

```bash
docker build -t supplychain-lstm .
docker run -p 8080:8080 supplychain-lstm
```
