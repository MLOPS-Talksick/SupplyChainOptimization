eCommerce-Chatbot using LangGraph (Verta)
Introduction
The Verta Chatbot project is a sophisticated AI-driven solution designed to enhance user interactions with product information. Deployed as a serverless FASTAPI API on Cloud Run, it serves users by answering questions about products, leveraging both metadata and user reviews for context. The chatbot utilizes a multi-agent workflow, with distinct agents performing specialized roles. A Metadata Agent is responsible for summarizing product descriptions, while a Retriever Agent fetches relevant data from a vector store containing user reviews. This allows the chatbot to answer a wide range of user inquiries, drawing on both product details and feedback from other customers.

The database for this solution is hosted on PostgreSQL in Google Cloud Platform (GCP), ensuring scalable, reliable storage. The project utilizes CI/CD pipelines via GitHub Actions, automating code deployment and ensuring seamless integration and delivery. Additionally, the system incorporates LLM-as-Judge to generate synthetic test questions for a set of products, while bias detection algorithms analyze potential biases in the chatbot's responses to ensure fairness and accuracy.

Experiment tracking is managed through MLflow, which captures model performance and experiment metadata, while Langfuse is used for tracing user interactions and gathering feedback to continuously improve the system. For monitoring and alerting, GCP Logs are utilized with notifications configured to send alerts to a Teams channel for real-time system health checks.

The chatbotâ€™s data orchestration is powered by Apache Airflow, while FaisDB is used as the vector store for storing product reviews and context. The system integrates three LLMs â€” GPT-4o-Mini, Llama 3.1-70B, and Llama 3.1-8B â€” running on four nodes to support its operations. The chatbotâ€™s multi-agent flow is managed using LangGraph, a framework for orchestrating complex workflows. For ease of use, the chatbot is also available as a Streamlit web app, with integration capabilities for custom frontends via API, secured using Auth Bearer Tokens.
