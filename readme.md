# SupplySense 
## Intelligent Demand Forecasting built for Smarter Supply Chains

Supply Sense is a production-ready, cloud-deployable LSTM pipeline for demand forecasting, supported by a full MLOps architecture on Google Cloud Platform (Vertex AI). The goal is to enable smarter demand prediction and a leaner supply chain through automated deep learning forecasts and end-to-end MLOps integration. Accurate demand forecasting can mean the difference between costly stockouts or overstocks and maximized profitability, and LSTM neural networks excel at capturing sequential patterns in data for more precise forecasts. This project combines that forecasting power with robust automation to streamline supply chain decisions.
