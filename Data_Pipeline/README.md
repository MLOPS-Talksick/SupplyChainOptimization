# Data Pipeline Test Fixes

## Issues Fixed

1. **Deprecated Parameter Warning**
   - Fixed the deprecated `check_dtype` parameter in `assert_frame_equal` calls by replacing it with `check_dtypes`.
   - This addresses the deprecation warnings in the test output.

2. **Test Assertion Improvement**
   - Enhanced the `test_compute_most_frequent_price_missing_group_column` test to properly assert the exception message.
   - Now the test verifies that the error message contains information about the missing column.

3. **Date Conversion Error Handling**
   - Modified the `convert_feature_types` function to handle date conversion errors more gracefully.
   - Added a `strict=False` parameter to the cast method for the Date column to convert invalid dates to null instead of raising an exception.

4. **Import Path Handling**
   - Fixed import issues in the test files by adding proper path handling.
   - Added `sys.path.append` to ensure imports work correctly in both direct and package import contexts.

## Remaining Issues to Address

1. **Group By Operation Error**
   - The error related to the group_by operation in `compute_most_frequent_price` function when using "Month" as a grouping column that doesn't exist.
   - Recommendation: Add validation in the `compute_most_frequent_price` function to check if all columns in the `time_granularity` list exist in the DataFrame before attempting to group by them.

2. **Remove Invalid Records Error**
   - The error in `remove_invalid_records` function related to missing "Product Name" column.
   - Recommendation: Add validation in the `remove_invalid_records` function to check if the required columns exist before attempting to filter on them.

3. **Test Environment Setup**
   - Consider using a virtual environment for testing to ensure consistent dependencies.
   - Make sure all required packages are installed with the correct versions.

## Test Coverage

The current test coverage is 90%, which is good. The main areas that need improvement are:

- `Data_Pipeline/__init__.py`: 50% coverage
- `Data_Pipeline/scripts/post_validation.py`: 42% coverage

## Next Steps

1. Implement the remaining fixes for the group_by operation and remove_invalid_records function.
2. Run the full test suite to verify all tests pass.
3. Consider adding more tests to improve coverage for the modules with lower coverage.
